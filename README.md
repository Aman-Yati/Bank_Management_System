Getting Started Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x: Download Python
MySQL: Download MySQL
MySQL Connector for Python: Install using pip install mysql-connector-python
Tkinter: Usually comes pre-installed with Python (if not, you can install it via pip install tk)

Set up the MySQL database:

Create a database (e.g., bank_db) in MySQL.
Run the provided SQL scripts (found in database/ folder) to create necessary tables like ALL_ACCOUNTS.

Run the project:

python bms.py

Usage

On running the application, you will be presented with a graphical user interface (GUI).
You can create a new bank account, view account details, update information, and perform transactions (deposit/withdraw).
The system will handle backend database operations automatically.

Limitations

The application currently supports basic account management and transaction operations. Features like loan management, customer services, and advanced reporting are not included.
The security is relatively simple (password hashing) and might not be sufficient for production-level banking systems.
The application does not support multi-user functionality; it is designed for single-user interaction.
